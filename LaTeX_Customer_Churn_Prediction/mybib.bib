abstract = {Customer churn has become a critical issue, especially in the competitive and mature credit card industry. From an economic and risk management perspective, it is important to understand customer characteristics in order to retain customers and differentiate high-quality credit customers from bad ones. However, studies have not yet adequately introduced rules based on customer characteristics and churn forms of original data. This study uses rough set theory, a rule-based decision-making technique, to extract rules related to customer churn; then uses a flow network graph, a path-dependent approach, to infer decision rules and variables; and finally presents the relationships between rules and different kinds of churn. An empirical case of credit card customer churn is also illustrated. In this study, we collect 21,000 customer samples, equally divided into three classes: survival, voluntary churn and involuntary churn. The data from these samples includes demographic, psychographic and transactional variables for analyzing and segmenting customer characteristics. The results show that this combined model can fully predict customer churn and provide useful information for decision-makers in devising marketing strategy.}

abstract = {In this paper, two data mining algorithms are applied to build a churn prediction model using credit card data collected from a real Chinese bank. The contribution of four variable categories: customer information, card information, risk information, and transaction activity information are examined. The paper analyzes a process of dealing with variables when data is obtained from a database instead of a survey. Instead of considering the all 135 variables into the model directly, it selects the certain variables from the perspective of not only correlation but also economic sense. In addition to the accuracy of analytic results, the paper designs a misclassification cost measurement by taking the two types error and the economic sense into account, which is more suitable to evaluate the credit card churn prediction model. The algorithms used in this study include logistic regression and decision tree which are proven mature and powerful classification algorithms. The test result shows that regression performs a little better than decision tree.}
